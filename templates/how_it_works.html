                        <h3>So What Exactly Is This Website About?</h3>
                        <p>This is a revision question bank for those preparing for The Institute of Chartered Accountants
                        of Nigeria (ICAN) forthcoming professional examinations.</p>
                        <p>If you require something to help you guage your preparedness or you need something extra to
                        add to your preparation efforts, then this is a valuable resource for you.</p>
                        <p>There are multiple choice questions and then open ended questions. For each type, you can
                        choose for the website engine to throw you questions from a whole level, or from a whole paper, or
                        you can get specific and choose to get questions from a particular topic.</p>

                        <h3>They Are ICAN Past Questions Abi?</h3>
                        <p>....em, NO. Our website is not an ICAN past question dump like you find a lot these days.
                        A lot of our questions are modelled on ICAN past questions though but if ICAN past
                        questions are enough to pass, there should be almost no failures in ICAN exams. A lot of
                        people still fail after using just past questions to practice and that's why we also model our
                        question based on ICAN recommended books.</p>

                        <p> There is a "hotness bar" which shows after you 
                        answer each question in the multiple choice section. 
                        It shows your performance on previous attempts at each 
                        question.
                        A red shows a wrong answer and a green shows a correct answer.<p>
                        <h5>

                        </h5>
                        <p> The greener the bar, the better. If your hotness bar
                        for a particular question keeps showing red, it is an
                        indicator of a need to study that topic more.</p>
